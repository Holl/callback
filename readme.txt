This is a Django App, using TastyPie, to help Actors find Auditions.

Currently the logic exists to create two different kinds of profiles: Actor and Production.
Auditions and Tags can also be created on the database.

No front-end logic currently exists.  This is a work in progress- let me know if you have any advice!
